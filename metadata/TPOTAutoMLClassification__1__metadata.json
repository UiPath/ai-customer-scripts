  "description":"Please train this ML Package before deploying it as it will not return anything otherwise.   \n\nTPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data. Once TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there. TPOT is built on top of scikit-learn, so all the code it generates should look familiar to scikit-learn users.   \n\nThe model is based on a publication entitled \"Scaling tree-based automated machine learning to biomedical big data with a feature set selector.\" from Trang T. Le, Weixuan Fu and Jason H. Moore (2020) and \"Evaluation of a Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool for Automating Data Science.\" from Randal S. Olson, Nathan Bartley, Ryan J. Urbanowicz, and Jason H. Moore. ",
