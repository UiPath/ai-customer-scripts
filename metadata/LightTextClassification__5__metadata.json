    "description": "This is the preview version of a generic, retrainable model for text classification. It supports all languages based on Latin characters, such as English, French, Spanish, and others. This ML Package must be trained, and if deployed without training first, the deployment will fail with an error stating that the model is not trained. This model operates on bag of Words and supports two variations of algorithms, one based on Logistic Regression and the other one based on Random Forest. You can switch between these two algorithms using environment variables.",
